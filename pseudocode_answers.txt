Short Answer
1- Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode in order to develop algorithms. 
It's a way to plan and visualise your future algorithm by writing statements explaining the different steps and actions of your algorithm. 

2- If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Basically nothing would happen as it made to be read by human, not a machine.
