1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?

The advantage of using linked list is that you optimise the memory of your processor by not leaving any empty space which could be allocated to other files. This is happening because the system allocates the first available node to fill the need. 
However, this can cause some inefficiency as while looking for let's say a certain file, the system will have to go through each node in order to find it. Finally, extra memory space for a link is necessary. 


2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.

A playlist could be an example as this is a list of elements in list linked to each other by using pointers. 

Programming Questions

The way I use to solve the question is to usually try to visualise how the code reacts based on my knowledge and experience. Then I'll try solving the issue myself by modifying the code and experience. Finally I'll be looking at extra resources online to see what's missing. 


1. The linked list push function should take a value, create a node, and add it to the end of a list. Below is pseudocode for a push function for a singly linked list. However, there is something wrong with it. Submit both an explanation of the bug and a functional implementation of the method.

The first step should have been to switch the IF step right after the node creation. On that step a tail could also have been created, set to tail. 

FUNCTION push(element)

CREATE node
	SET node.value TO element
	SET node.next TO null

IF the head node does not exist
	THEN SET head to node

ELSE
	SET current to head
 	SET current.next to node

END IF

END FUNCTION 

2. Given an unsorted singly linked list, remove all duplicates from the linked list.

class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class SinglyLinkList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }

  push(value) {
    let newNode = new Node(value);
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode;
      this.tail = this.head;
    } else {
      this.tail.next = newNode;
      this.tail = newNode;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }

  removeDup() {
    if (this.head == null || this.head.next == null) return this.head;
    let current = this.head;
    while (current != null) {
      var prev = current;
      var nextNode = current.next;
      while (nextNode !== null) {
        if (current.value == nextNode.value) {
          prev.next = nextNode.next;
          this.length--;
        } else {
          prev = nextNode;
        }
        nextNode = nextNode.next;
      }
      current = current.next;
    }
    return this;
  }

  print() {
    let current = this.head;
    let count = 0;
    let arr = [];
    while (count < this.length) {
      arr.push(current.value);
      current = current.next;
      count++;
    }
    console.log(arr);
  }
}

let list = new SinglyLinkList();
console.log(list.head);
list.push(1);
console.log(list.head);
list.push(2);
console.log(list.head.next);
list.push(3);
//console.log(list.head.next.next);
list.push(4);
list.push(4);
list.push(5);
list.push(4);
list.print();
list.removeDup();
list.print();


3. Given an unsorted singly linked list, reverse it.

class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class SinglyLinkList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }

  push(value) {
    let newNode = new Node(value);
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode;
      this.tail = this.head;
    } else {
      this.tail.next = newNode;
      this.tail = newNode;
    }
    this.length++;
    return this;
  }

  print() {
    let current = this.head;
    let count = 0;
    let arr = [];
    while (count < this.length) {
      arr.push(current.value);
      current = current.next;
      count++;
    }
    console.log(arr);
  }

  reverse() {
    if (!this.head) return false;
    let node = this.head;
    this.head = this.tail;
    this.tail = node;

    let prev = null;
    let next;

    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      next = node.next;
      node.next = prev;
      prev = node;
      node = next;
    }
    return true;
  }
}

let list = new SinglyLinkList();
console.log(list.head);
list.push(1);
console.log(list.head);
list.push(2);
console.log(list.head.next);
list.push(3);
//console.log(list.head.next.next);
list.push(4);
list.push(4);
list.push(5);
list.push(4);
list.print();
list.reverse();
list.print();
